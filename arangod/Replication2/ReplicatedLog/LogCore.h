/**
 * @brief The persistent core of a replicated log. There must only ever by one
 * instance of LogCore for a particular physical log. It is always held by the
 * single active LogParticipantI instance, which in turn lives in the
 * ReplicatedLog instance for this particular log. That is, usually by either a
 * LogLeader, or a LogFollower. If the term changes (and with that
 * leader/followers and/or configuration like writeConcern), a new participant
 * instance is created, and the core moved from the old to the new instance. If
 * the server is currently neither a leader nor follower for the log, e.g.
 * during startup, the LogCore is held by a LogUnconfiguredParticipant instance.
 *
 * TODO When the unique_ptr to the LogCore is destroyed by accident, it must be
 *      moved back to the responsible ReplicatedLog instance in the vocbase.
 *      Add a deleter that does this, or something similar.
